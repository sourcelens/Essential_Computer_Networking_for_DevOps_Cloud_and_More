b) DHCPOFFER  
c) DHCPREQUEST  
d) DHCPDISCOVER  

**Answer** a)  

**Description**

12 : What is the purpose of the DHCPRELEASE message?  

a) To request a new IP address from the DHCP server  
b) To renew the current IP address lease  
c) To inform the DHCP server that the client is relinquishing its IP address  
d) To change the default gateway  

**Answer** c)  

**Description**

19 : What is address lease time in DHCP server?  

a) The time it takes for a DHCP server to acquire a new IP address pool  
b) The duration for which a DHCP client holds an assigned IP address  
c) The maximum number of IP addresses a DHCP server can assign  
d) The time it takes for a DHCP server to respond to a client request  


**Answer** b)  

**Description**  

The address lease time refers to the period during which a DHCP client can use the IP address assigned by the DHCP server. After this period expires, the client may renew the lease if it continues to need network access and to be a part of subnet.

20 : What is address reservation in a DHCP server?  

<img src="Images/lecture44_quizpic_18.png" width="500"/>  

a) A feature that automatically assigns IP addresses to new devices joining the subnet

c) The process of leasing IP addresses for a specific period of time  
d) A mechanism to secure IP addresses from unauthorized access  

**Answer** b)  

**Description**  

Address reservation in DHCP allows network administrators to assign a specific IP address to a device, ensuring that the device always receives the same IP address whenever it is part of that subnet. This is typically based on the device's MAC address to ensure consistency.
