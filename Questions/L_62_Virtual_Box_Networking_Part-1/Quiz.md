3 : Which all statement/s is/are true about NAT mode of network adapter in Virtual Box vm?  

a) It is the default networking mode in Oracle VM VirtualBox  
b) The virtual machine is invisible and unreachable from the outside internet  
c) A virtual machine with NAT enabled acts much like a real computer that connects to the Internet through a router  
d) All the above  

**Answer** d)  

**Description**  

All statements are correct. NAT is the default networking mode in Oracle VM VirtualBox. A virtual machine with NAT enabled acts much like a real computer that connects to the Internet through a router.  The disadvantage of NAT mode is that, much like a private network behind a router, the virtual machine is invisible and unreachable from the outside internet. You cannot run a server this way unless you set up port forwarding. https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#networkingmodes
