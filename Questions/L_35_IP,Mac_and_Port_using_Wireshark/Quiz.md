5 : What is the purpose of the NAT (Network Address Translation) technique?  

a) To translate domain names to IP addresses  
b) To convert private local IP addresses to public IP addresses  
c) To encrypt data being sent over the network  
d) To assign MAC addresses to devices on a network  

**Answer** b)
