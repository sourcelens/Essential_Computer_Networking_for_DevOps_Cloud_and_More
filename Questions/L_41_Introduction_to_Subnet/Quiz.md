1 : What is a subnet?  

a) A subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network  
b) A protocol used to exchange routing information between routers  
c) A physical device used to connect different networks  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** a)  

**Description**  

A subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting.

2 : Why is the concept of a subnet important in computer networking?  

a) It helps reduce the number of MAC addresses needed  
b) It eliminates the need for routers  
c) It increases the geographical distance between devices  
d) Allows for the division of an IP address space into smaller, more manageable segments  

**Answer** d)  

**Description**  

A subnet allows for the division of an IP address space into smaller, more manageable segments, improving network organization, security, and performance.

3 : How does subnetting address the issue of geographical constraints?  

a) It ensures all devices are connected to the same router  
b) It divides the network into smaller, localized groups  
c) Both of the above  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** b)  

**Description**  

Subnetting divides the network into smaller, localized groups, which helps in managing geographical constraints by keeping the subnet within a close proximity.

4 : Which of the following statements is true about subnet sizes?  

a) Subnets must always have exactly 256 devices  
b) Subnets cannot be smaller than 32 addresses  
c) Subnets should always be as large as possible to minimize the number of subnets  
d) Subnets can have various sizes, but practical considerations often dictate sizes like 256 addresses for manageability  

**Answer** d)  

**Description**  

Subnets can have various sizes, but practical considerations often dictate sizes like 256 addresses for manageability.
