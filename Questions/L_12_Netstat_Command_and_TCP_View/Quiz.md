3 : What does the IP address "127.0.0.1" in the TCP view represent here?  

a) The server's external IP address  
b) The client's external IP address  
c) The loopback IP address  
d) The router's IP address  

**Answer** c)  

**Description**  

The IP address "127.0.0.1" represents the loopback IP address. This address is used to refer to the local machine itself, allowing network communications to loop back to the same device without going through a physical network interface. It is commonly used for testing and troubleshooting network-related issues.

6 : What is the significance of the different process IDs (PID) observed in the TCP View?  

a) They represent the port each process listen  
b) They indicate different programs or applications  
c) They are randomly assigned by the operating system  
d) They correspond to specific network protocols  

**Answer** b)  

**Description**  

The different process IDs (PID) observed in the TCP View indicate that each entry corresponds to a different program or application running on the system. Each PID uniquely identifies a separate instance of a program, suggesting that multiple programs are involved in network communication.
