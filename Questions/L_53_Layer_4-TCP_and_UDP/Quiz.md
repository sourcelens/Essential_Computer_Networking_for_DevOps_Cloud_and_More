1 : Which of the following is NOT true about TCP?  

a) It is a connection-oriented protocol  
b) It ensures that packets are delivered correctly  
c) It operates on the IP layer  
d) It uses port numbers to identify applications  

**Answer** c)  

**Description**  

It is incorrect because TCP operates on layer 4, not the IP layer (layer 3). So, it is the answer.

2 : What is the main role of a port number in TCP and UDP?  

a) To identify the hardware address of a device  
b) To specify the application or service that should handle the packet  
c) To determine the network path of the packet  
d) To ensure the packet is delivered in sequence  


**Answer** b)  

**Description**  

It is correct as port numbers specify the application or service to handle the packet.

3 : What is one of the key differences between TCP and UDP?  

a) TCP operates on layer 3, while UDP operates on layer 4  
b) TCP is connection-oriented, while UDP is connectionless  
c) TCP does not use port numbers, while UDP does  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** b)  

**Description**  

It is correct because TCP establishes a connection and ensures reliable delivery, while UDP does not. So, it is the answer.

4 : Which statement correctly describes a TCP connection?  

a) It does not require any form of acknowledgment  
b) It is less reliable than UDP  
c) It involves a sequence of packets with acknowledgements  
d) It is primarily used for small, insignificant data transfers  

**Answer** c)  

**Description**  

It is correct because TCP involves sending packets with sequence numbers and requiring acknowledgements. So, it is the answer.

5 : Which of the following best describes the purpose of layer 4 in the OSI model?  

a) Routing packets from source to destination  
b) Identifying which program or service should handle a packet  
c) Handling the physical transmission of data  
d) Encrypting the data before transmission  

**Answer** b)  

**Description**  

It is correct because layer 4 (transport layer) uses port numbers to identify the target application or service.

6 : Why is TCP considered more complex than UDP?  

a) TCP does not use port numbers  
b) TCP requires the creation of virtual circuits before data can be sent  
c) TCP ensures the correct delivery of packets using acknowledgements and retransmissions  
d) TCP operates on a lower layer than UDP  

**Answer** c)  

**Description**  

It is correct because TCP has mechanisms like acknowledgements and retransmissions to ensure reliable delivery.

7 : Why might an application choose to use UDP over TCP?  

a) For guaranteed data delivery  
b) For faster, less overhead communication  
c) For secure data transmission  
d) For ordering of packets  

**Answer** b)  

**Description**  

An application might choose UDP over TCP for faster communication with less overhead, especially in scenarios where occasional packet loss is acceptable, such as live streaming or online gaming.

8 : What unique feature does TCP have that ensures data integrity?  

a) Port numbers  
b) Acknowledgements and retransmissions  
c) Lower latency  
d) Simplified header format  

**Answer** b)  

**Description**  

TCP uses acknowledgements and retransmissions to ensure data integrity. If a packet is lost or corrupted, TCP will retransmit it until it is correctly received.

9 : Which of the following statements is true about UDP?  

a) UDP is a connection-oriented protocol  
b) UDP guarantees packet delivery  
c) UDP is more complex than TCP  
d) UDP is a connectionless protocol  

**Answer** d)  

**Description**  

UDP is a connectionless protocol, meaning it does not establish a connection before sending packets and does not guarantee delivery or order.
