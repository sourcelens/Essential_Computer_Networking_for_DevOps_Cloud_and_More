1 : What is the key difference between primary memory and secondary memory in a computer system?  

a) Primary memory is slower than secondary memory  
b) Primary memory retains its content even when the power is off  
c) Secondary memory retains its content when the power is off  
d) Secondary memory is faster than primary memory  

**Answer** c)  

**Description**  

Primary memory (RAM) loses its content when the power is off, while secondary memory (such as hard drives and SSDs) retains data even without power.

2 : Which device listed below is considered a primary memory device in a computer system?  

a) RAM  
b) CPU  
c) Hard Drive  
d) Network Interface Card  

**Answer** a)  

**Description**  

RAM is primary memory. It is short-term memory. RAM does not retain its content even when the power is off.

3 : What role does the operating system play in a computer system?  

a) It directly performs all complex operations required by applications  
b) It abstracts the complexity of hardware devices and provides a user-friendly interface  
c) It replaces the need for device drivers  
d) It acts as primary memory  

**Answer** b)  

**Description**  

The operating system abstracts the complexities of the hardware and provides an interface that allows users and applications to interact with the hardware without needing to manage low-level details.

4 : Why are device drivers crucial in an operating system?  

a) They enable the computer to run faster by improving battery life on desktops.  
b) They allow the operating system to communicate with hardware devices  
c) They are required only for network devices  
d) They prevent the operating system from accessing certain hardware  

**Answer** b)  

**Description**  

Device drivers act as translators between the operating system and hardware devices, enabling the OS to send commands and receive data from the hardware.

5 : What is the purpose of the directory "C:\Windows\System32" in a Windows operating system?  

a) It only stores user documents and files  
b) It contains most of the operating system components and files  
c) It is used for temporary file storage  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** b)  

**Description**  

The "C:\Windows\System32" directory houses the critical components and files of the Windows operating system, including system libraries, drivers, and the kernel.

6 : What does the term "kernel" refer to in an operating system?  

a) A type of hardware component  
b) The primary user interface of the OS  
c) The core part of the operating system managing system resources  
d) A secondary storage device  

**Answer** c)  

**Description**  

The kernel is the fundamental part of an operating system, responsible for managing system resources, such as CPU, memory, and hardware devices.

7 : Why are certain hardware devices displayed with a question mark in Device Manager?  

<img src="Images/lecture22_quizpic_2" width="500"/>  

a) They are functioning correctly  
b) They are not physically connected to the computer  
c) They do not have the appropriate device driver installed  
d) They are recognized as software rather than hardware  

**Answer** c)  

**Description**  

A question mark in Device Manager indicates that the operating system does not have the necessary device driver to communicate with the hardware device.

8 : What is the primary purpose of a network interface card (NIC) in a computer system?  

a) To perform arithmetic operations  
b) To manage primary and secondary memory  
c) To connect the computer to a network  
d) To display graphics on the monitor  

**Answer** c)  

**Description**  

A network interface card (NIC) facilitates network connectivity by allowing the computer to communicate with other devices over a network.

9 : What is the primary difference between user mode and kernel mode in an operating system?  

a) User mode can directly access hardware, while kernel mode cannot  
b) Kernel mode can directly access hardware and execute privileged instructions, while user mode cannot  
c) User mode has unrestricted access to all system resources, while kernel mode has restricted access  
d) Both user mode and kernel mode have equal access to system resources  

**Answer** b)  

**Description**  

Kernel mode has unrestricted access to all system resources, including hardware and memory, and can execute privileged instructions. User mode, on the other hand, runs with restricted access to ensure system stability and security.
